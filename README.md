### Installation

Current installation involves installing this tool locally using the --user flag with pip (pip install --user package_name). This installs `ciphy` in the user-specific site-packages directory, which helps to avoid conflicts with system packages and allows for easy management of user-specific packages.

#### Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Merlin1A/ciphify.git
```

#### Change to the project directory
```bash
cd ciphify
```

#### Install the package
```bash
pip install --user --editable .
```

<br>
*Please note that is also possible to install this in a virtual environement or container like `venv`, `conda`, `pipenv`, `docker`, etc. At the moment, I have not written installation intructions for those environments, but the changes to make `ciphy` work in those environments should be small.*
